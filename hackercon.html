This talk also shares details of the Vulnerability Discovery for All research project sponsored by Tufts, University of Chicago, UMD's SP2 Lab.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Kelsey Fulton</strong> is a computer science Ph.D. student at the University of Maryland. Her research explores the human factors of information security with a focus on software developers and security professionals and understanding their processes and mental models. Specifically, she aims to explore the hurdles and difficulties to secure development for professionals to provide evidence-based recommendations for policy, education, and programming language and tool changes. Her most recent work focuses on the barriers to adoption of secure programming languages, the best methods for studying software developers and security professionals, and understanding the barriers faced by underrepresented groups in security.</p><p>------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p><strong>Why Good Samaritan Laws are Needed featuring (Panel)</strong></p><p>Speakers: Justin Wynn and Gary De Mercurio - Moderated by Chloé Messdaghi</p><p>Abstract: In September 2019, the Iowa state asked cybersecurity firm Coalfire to conduct a penetration test to see if its staff could gain access to sensitive data or equipment.&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">Two Coalfire employees found a door to the Dallas Courthouse open, and when they closed the door to see if it would lock and then attempted to open it, an alarm was set off. Following protocol, the employees waited for police to arrive and showed them their paperwork. Initially, they were told they were "good to go," but moments later, a local sheriff showed up and arrested them; they spent the night in jail. This panel shares their story, their experience of the day and afterwards.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><strong>Justin Wynn</strong> is a Senior Security Consultant with Coalfire who specializes in physical security and regularly performs network, application, wireless, and social engineering penetration tests.

We'll also cover dos and don't for the briefing itself so you can hopefully land your message, get it in print, and build a lasting relationship with the reporter.&nbsp;</span></p><p>As an information security journalist, <strong>Fahmida Y Rashid</strong> has spent over a decade analyzing news events and demystifying security technology for IT professionals, business managers, and consumers. As the executive editor of VentureBeat, she leads the newsroom and a team of contributors to cover the intersection of AI and data technology for enterprise technology decision makers. At VentureBeat, she looks at the intersection of security with AI and data. She co-founded Decipher, an online security magazine dedicated to making sense of current events. She believes that security requires an interdisciplinary approach and draws on ideas from various fields, including psychology, economics, and political science, to explain important concepts. She focuses on network operations and application development because they require in-depth understanding of the relevant technologies and workflows. Before becoming a journalist, she spent ten years in tech, as a network administrator, a software developer, a management consultant, and a product manager. Prior to launching Decipher, she wrote for various business and tech trade publications, including CSO Online, InfoWorld, eWEEK, Dark Reading, CRN, PC Magazine, and Tom's Guide.</p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">------------------------------------------------------------------------</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><strong>Seeking The Upside</strong></span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Speaker: Amélie E. Koran</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">It has been relatively easy to “bag” on the public sector when it comes to the news about how well (or not) they’ve handled putting the messaging about improving security into actual action. However, from this inside, the challenge remains with not only overcoming getting all the right people to consider the path they must follow, but aligning all the right resources in order to mark the minimum of accomplishments. This talk will provide a short discussion on the challenges people tend to face within the public sector, primarily Federal, when it comes to initiating, planning and delivering security solutions to the Federal government and where new ways of executing them may result in greater successes and wider public support.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><strong>Amélie</strong> is a Senior Technology Advocate at Splunk, focused on helping organizations transform, grow and secure themselves in the ever evolving world of technologies and their accompanying challenges. She arrives at Splunk after nearly 25 years as a technologist, from systems administration and engineering to executive technology leadership in various industries, academia, NGOs, and the government. In the last decade, she’s supported various Federal agencies, leading various projects and initiatives, including modernization activities, cybersecurity policy, and security architecture and operations. Amélie E. Koran served as the Deputy Chief Information Officer and most recently as Chief Technology Officer for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Inspector General. However, Amélie’s path prior to today took her the long way around − through multiple industry sectors, academia, and the public sector. Her professional experience includes time spent at The Walt Disney Company, Carnegie Mellon University’s CERT/CC, Mandiant, The World Bank, Constellation Energy (now Exelon) and The American Chemical Society. She began her time in the public sector as Lead Enterprise Security Architect for the U.S. Department of the Interior, eventually moving on to lead Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation implementation for the U.S. Treasury Department. Amélie later spent time on a leadership development rotation as part of the President’s Management Council Fellowship serving the Federal CIO in supporting cybersecurity policy analysis and legislative review, where she took an active role in the government-wide Open Data Initiative and helped in giving “birth” to the United States Digital Service (USDS). She’s an ardent advocate for innovative approaches to hiring talent and rationally applying security strategies and technologies for the public and private sector. Often seen “soapboxing” about technology workforce development, training and recruiting policies, practices and techniques, she’s mostly observed providing measured guidance to InfoSec Twitter at @webjedi.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">------------------------------------------------------------------------</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><strong>The Evolving Cybersecurity Policy Landscape and How It Impacts You</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Speaker: Amit Elazari</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Security is one of the most evolving and impactful landscapes in the regulatory sphere.

We think bad, but do good, view technology and often the world in a very different way to the people who build it; and form the immune system for our digitally-connected society.</p><p>Of all the problems the internet has, there seems to be one that rules them all: It doesn’t understand how to work with its immune system.&nbsp;</p><p>In this session, I’ll run through the past/present/future of vulnerability disclosure, and give a run-through of disclose.io: an open-source and vendor-agnostic initiative to make conversations between builders and breakers safe, standardized, and simple. I’ll close with a Call To Action for all participants with simple ways to help and get involved.</p><p><strong>Casey</strong> is the Chairman, Founder and CTO of Bugcrowd. He is an 20+ year veteran of information security as a career, and has been inventing stuff and generally getting technology to do things it isn't supposed to since childhood.</p><p>Professionally, he has worn a variety of hats, working as a pentester, security and risk consultant and solutions architect, CSO, and then most recently as a career entrepreneur and company leader.

Since then, the concept has become even more critical, and it is playing out across a stage that includes nonprofits, the most valuable companies and the most powerful countries in the world. This is the story of how we got there.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">A security journalist for more than two decades, <strong>Joseph Menn</strong> is the author of the bestseller "Cult of the Dead Cow: How the Original Hacking Supergroup Might Just Save the World," first published in 2019. It revealed that then-presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke had belonged to the oldest surviving and most influential group of U.S. hackers and explained the origins of hacktivism and ethical security work. The New York Times Book Review called it "a hugely important piece of the puzzle for anyone who wants to understand the forces shaping the internet age.” It was named one of the 10 best nonfiction works of the year by Hudson Booksellers, one of the five cybersecurity books everyone should read by the Wall Street Journal, and inducted into the Cybersecurity Canon project’s Hall of Fame.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Menn is an investigative technology reporter for Reuters, having previously worked at the Financial Times and the Los Angeles Times, where he began writing about cybersecurity in 1999.

Thousands of companies now offer vulnerability disclosure policies (VDPs), and that number is increasing every day. With such policies, not only are hackers better protected in disclosing vulnerabilities, but the public can stay better informed about security practices across organizations. 2020 proved to be a breakout year for vulnerability disclosure policies, with vulnerabilities launched across every U.S. federal civilian agency, the elections industry, and more. Yet with these advances comes an increased need to ensure such policies are effective and protect both organizations and hackers. As evidenced by past legal disputes, the process of building and abiding to a VDP is nontrivial. In this talk, learn about the history of the VDP, ongoing legal troubles, and best practices moving forward to ensure the efficacy of VDPs. Case studies of action by the United States and Netherlands governments demonstrate that VDPs can be implemented as a standard in order to increase public security. By structuring VDPs in the right way, such policies can be implemented to offer transparency critical to increasing public trust around security.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><strong>Jack Cable</strong> is a security researcher and student at Stanford University. Jack formerly worked for the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to help secure the 2020 election.

By challenging socially constructed beliefs of what and who is a hacker, we have the ability to change the current landscape and update legislation.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">&nbsp;At this time, 1 out 4 hackers do not report a vulnerability if the organization doesn't have a vulnerability disclosure. This is due to the fear of being prosecuted because the public holds biases that negatively impact the hacker community. Even when good faith research is shared, it can be ignored or misunderstood. This is also the reason why legislation needs changes. No representation of the hacker community has been part of any laws being created and enacted.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">This talk discusses what we can do together to change the situation, what actions are needed immediately, and the mission of Hacking is NOT a Crime.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><strong>Chloé Messdaghi</strong> is passionate about keeping people safe and empowered both on and offline, she is also interested in increasing the number of marginalized genders in information security. She is the co-founder of Women of Security (WoSEC) and Hacking is NOT a Crime, and the founder of WeAreHackerz.

Carey</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Information that can be easily accessed and shared benefits everyone in the community. Many people dream of being able to publish a book but don’t know where to start. It has never been easier to self publish a book. Many people don’t know that Tribe of Hackers started off as a self-published book after the concept for the book was rejected by publishers.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Tribe of Hackers started with an idea: to inspire folks of all ages and backgrounds to learn more about cybersecurity and to get their foot in the door. In this talk, we will explain how we took that idea and turned it into a physical book that has been shared with thousands of people globally. The series has allowed hundreds of contributors to share their resources and experiences with those inside and outside the hacker community.</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">You don’t need to be an expert writer to publish your own book. There is so much knowledge to share and hopefully this session will inspire and equip the attendees to go out and share their skills and information through publishing.</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jennifer-jin/   " class="text-primary" target="_blank">Jennifer Jin</a> is a Product Marketing Manager at Mio where she works with sales, engineering, and marketing teams to launch products to market.
