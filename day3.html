                        <small class="mbr-author-desc mbr-italic mbr-light mbr-fonts-style display-7">A company, regardless of its size and market power, may go out of business or lose a lot of value because of a security incident on its information system. The number of vulnerabilities and the interest of cyber-attackers is only increasing. With the advent of the monetization of botnet cyber attacks or the installation of crypto-miners for example, the threats are going more varied and intensified, but less targeted. The vast majority of companies are digital and increasingly exposed on the Internet. The level of cyber exposure is also higher. The ""Cyber"" risk has become vital. Today, everything has changed and tomorrow everything will change even faster. Where manual analysis was sufficient, paradigms of risk assessment are moving towards more automation. But **we need intelligent automation**.<br>This automation strategy also tends to address the drastic lack of competent cyber security resources and retention of talents. The automation of recurrent, time-consuming and low-value-added tasks will allow teams to focus on more complex and therefore more motivating topics. To efficiently support this strategy, we developed PatrOwl, an Open Source, Free and Scalable Security Operations Orchestration Platform. Technically, PatrOwl is a solution for automating calls to commercial or open source tools that perform checks. To date, more than 140 tools or online services are supported. Beyond centralizing the results (vulnerabilities, meta-data, asset metadata) obtained, the PatrOwl analysis engine compares these results with its knowledge base and other third-party services to determine scenarios of attacks (predictive analysis) or to trigger actions (alerting, program calls, ...). Largely customizable, PatrOwl is suitable for supporting penetration testing, vulnerability audit and compliance, static source audit, threat research (CTI) and security incident response activities (SOC / DFIR).</small>

                        <small class="mbr-author-desc mbr-italic mbr-light mbr-fonts-style display-7">Since the discovery of MS08-067, a buffer overflow vulnerability triggered by a specially crafted RPC request, much has been done to create a working exploit to target vulnerable hosts. This work by the security community was largely motivated by the vulnerability’s impact – unauthenticated remote code execution, in a SYSTEM context, against numerous versions of Microsoft Windows. It is also used by the well-known Conficker worm. The purpose of this talk is to get a better understanding of using a debugger and looking at the low-level process of exploiting the vulnerability.  </small>

However, there is a problem with those habits and standarts;<br>- There are tons of tools but no operation management,<br>- No aggregation between these tools,<br>- When OPSEC fails due to problems above or any other reason, it’s essential to possess the capability of maintaining robust infrastructure which can be recreated if discovered, and more importantly, without any issues upon deployment.<br>In this talk, infrastructure challenges we face as a red teamer will be discussed. Along with challenges, a solution will be proposed based on DevOps practices such as;<br>- Design your infrastructure based on the standarts and habits which your team has<br>- Create playbooks which suits your needs based on your design<br>- Create CI pipeline to test and maintain your playbooks</small>

                        <small class="mbr-author-desc mbr-italic mbr-light mbr-fonts-style display-7">"Penetration Testing (Pentesting) involves skilled cybersecurity professionals generating a plan of attack for finding and exploiting vulnerabilities in the networks, and applications. The current procedure used in pen-testing is semi-automated at best and requires significant human effort. Moreover, the plan of attack followed by pen-testers may not yield best outcomes in terms of exploiting vulnerabilities in the provided time. Our framework, ASAP utilizes software vulnerabilities and network topology information to provide an artificial intelligence-based automated attack plan. <br>Our framework Autonomous Security Analysis and Penetration Testing (ASAP) utilizes the reachability information between different network hosts and software vulnerabilities to generate a state transition graph known as attack graph. Each state in the attack graph represents the current privilege of the attacker. The attack graph also encodes information about the possible next state transitions in the network. In effect attack graph maps all possible exploits and privilege escalations possible in a network. This information is provided to Artificial Intelligence (AI) module. The AI module utilizes a popular framework known as Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) to encode uncertainty over different state transitions, and reward obtained by attackers on achieving different privilege levels. The output generated by the AI module - Attack Policy provides the best course of action for a penetration tester/ red team member in the current network setup. &nbsp;The attack policy generated by the ASAP framework can be deployed on target enterprise networks using automated exploitation tools such as Metasploit. Based on our experimental evaluation in a cloud network setup, the attack policy generated by our framework does significantly better than human penetration testers in terms of finding and exploiting vulnerabilities in a network.

This talk gives the attacker's perspective on how common attack chains can be stopped before they spiral out of control.<br>This talk is fueled by two red team operators field experience in attacking modern enterprise environments. It will cover various tactics and techniques that are used with high success during red team engagements, as well as specific countermeasures that would hamper the success of the described attack chains. The speakers will cover a hypothetical red team style engagement, starting from a limited-knowledge basis on the Internet, moving to an internal foothold, leading to data compromise. This talk will focus on technical details at an executive level, and will be performed in a ""debrief"" style with no technical specifics or demos. "</small>

                        <small class="mbr-author-desc mbr-italic mbr-light mbr-fonts-style display-7">"With the explosion of GPU enabled processing power password cracking has long grown beyond the standard wordlist. New tools and techniques are being used in order to effectively and efficiently crack passwords that just a few years ago would have be unfathomable.<br>People often ask me, what is the best way to crack this hash, and the truth is it really depends. Let us introduce some of the more modern and best ways to attack passwords by analyzing the language structures and character patterns of passwords, as well as developing custom rules and rule chains to maximize effort. Password cracking is one of those things that has been around for a long time, however people often do not associate a methodology behind it and consider it just a tool. My presentation has a large amount of content to cover within a 50-minute window, therefore our demos are light and quick showing the different tools built for cracking locally, in the cloud, or in a distributed environment. I feel that by passing along the knowledge of the ins and outs of the tools will be more valuable than having people watch us crack passwords on the screen. The slide decks can be made available to participants and contains sample commands for them to try out each technique I present."</small>

He started his professional career at Prolexic Technologies (now Akamai), fighting DDOS attacks from “anonymous” and “lulzsec” against Fortune 100 companies. As an engineering co-founder of Zenedge Inc. (acquired by Oracle Inc.), José helped build technologies to fight bots and web-application attacks. While working at Splunk as a Security Architect, he built and released an auto-mitigation framework that has been used to automatically fight attacks in large organizations. He has also built security operation centers and run a public threat-intelligence service. Although security information has been the focus of his career, José has found that his true passion is in solving problems and creating solutions. As an example, he built an underwater remote-control vehicle called the SensorSub, which was used to test and measure toxicity in Miami's waterways.<br></p>
