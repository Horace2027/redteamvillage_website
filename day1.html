                        <small class="mbr-author-desc mbr-italic mbr-light mbr-fonts-style display-7">Under the best of circumstances, coordinating disclosure of vulnerabilities can be a challenge.  At times it can feel like everyone involved in CVD has conflicting motivations.  The truth is that all of us are aspiring to do the right thing for end-users based on our perspective.  The panel will share experiences and show how researchers and technology companies can work together to improve the impact of disclosing vulnerabilities on the technology ecosystem. Join CRob (Red Hat), Lisa Bradley (Dell), Katie Noble (Intel), Omar Santos (Cisco), Anders Fogh (Intel) and Daniel Gruss (TU Graz) for an exciting and engaging dialog between security researchers and industry experts on the Joy of coordinating vulnerability disclosure.<br> <br>Presentation Outline<br>This will be an interactive session between the panelists.  The following questions are seeds for what will be a dynamic and lively discussion:<br>What does CVD mean to you and what is your motivation to disclose?<br>What benefits have the panelists seen in coordinating vulnerability disclosure?<br>What problems have you had with CVD?<br>How does CVD work in open source projects?<br>How do you prepare for coordinated vulnerability disclosure and what challenges do you face?<br>How could researchers and industries work better together?<br> <br>Takeaways<br>Learn about the exciting world of Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure.<br>Hear from experts from both the research community as well as the vendors they report issues to.<br>Learn from the coordination mistakes from the past to not repeat them in the future.<br>Learn about the current struggles with CVD and what needs to be done to improve CVD.<br> <br>Problem to solve<br>The hope is that this constructive interaction will remove some of the impediments of relationships between product developers and security researchers. The goal is to open a door for dialogue that will bring more stability in the experiences we all have in coordinating vulnerability disclosure.  All technology users are impacted by security vulnerabilities, how those issues are communicated and dealt with are critical to impacted individuals and organizations to effectively manage the information security risk.  The panel hopes to show "both sides" of the issue and highlight our different perspectives, and ideally showcase we're all working to help secure end-users around the globe.&nbsp;<br></small>

But do you really need to be a 1337 H4x0r to compromise those systems? In this talk, I will be sharing (from a Red Team Perspective) How I was compromising the SWIFT, SPID, and SPEI systems in a Financial Institution until I gained root access to all the systems using basic hacking techniques like the pretty good old 1337 days. For the blue teamers, I will be sharing ways to detect these techniques that, although may appear simple, they pose a very challenging scenario to create a detection.</small>

                               Abstract</em></strong>: "In the not-too-distance past, it was fairly easy for red-teamers to conquer almost any environment with a combination of password sprays, or by leveraging social engineering to lure victims to fake login sites and harvest their credentials.  But in the current landscape, there are new road-blocks to contend with.  Nearly every company and organization has now deployed some form of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on their perimeter services.  Fortunately, for red-teamers, the vast majority of implementations of MFA across the Internet (email-based, SMS, OTP, and push requests) all share a common critical flaw that can still be easily circumvented using a modern revision of the classic âcredential harvestingâ attacks.  This talk will offer a comprehensive methodology for how a red team can effectively bypass nearly any MFA service using Python-Flask and browser emulation libraries (Mechanize or Selenium) to replay MFA credentials in real-time, establish legitimate user sessions, and then harvest the session tokens to assume access to those compromised sessions.  This methodology will prove once again, that the advantage is still square in the hands of the red team, and that even nowâ¦ALL YOUR BASE ARE BELONG TO US!!!</small>

The shift from on-premise data storage to the cloud constitutes a significant challenge and risk to the modern enterprise. The use of cloud file storage applications is on the rise for both consumer and business systems, which results in interesting data and metadata siting on endpoints. In this talk, we'll examine the large footprints of popular cloud file storage applications such as OneDrive and Box - learning what information can be enumerated from each cloud file storage solution. In some scenarios, data can be carved out from cache, restoring sensitive documents no longer on an endpoint.<br></small>

                        <small class="mbr-author-desc mbr-italic mbr-light mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong><em>Abstract</em></strong>: Most of us understand that it is a good idea to tailor an attack to a password policy. That being said, most password policies are fairly homogeneous. Does a minimum eight characters and at least three of four categories for complexity sound familiar? The hashcat-herders among us have prepared well for this endeavor. Many have hoarded hundreds of gigabytes of dumped passwords from hacked sites using these exact kinds of policies. Which means, when the hashes get dumped, sometimes more than half of a domain can be cracked in a single day. Soâ¦ what if you have to crack passwords written under a different policy, like a paranoid 15 character minimum? Those gigabytes of dictionaries, full of shorter passwords, arenât going to rockyou into domain admin anymore. Itâs time to dive into the hashes with combinations of combinators, purple rain attacks, and word-level linguistically correct Markov chains. Along with the techniques themselves, this presentation will include the real-world results of various cracking attacks against a ~6000 person domain, at a Fortune 500 with a mature security program. As well as some recommendations for policies that allow memorable passwords while actually making them difficult to crack.</small>
