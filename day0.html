The Great Spaghetti Monster isn’t too difficult to secure if you just stop and use common sense (wait, WHAT?) security best practices. These techniques are for everyone - even those who have been playing with Kubernetes for some time.<br>Let’s talk about Docker, baby!<br>You have to start somewhere, and containers are the place. Next, let’s intro Kubernetes and the magic world of orchestration and what it really means to orchestrate containers. A quick recorded demo of my raspberry pi cluster will be shown here.<br>As the brief Kubernetes demo concludes, it’s time to bring in security by demonstrating the security plug-ins and tools used. Techniques are shown for best-in-show k8s security configuration. Remember this concept - “Common Sense”? Let’s see if we can apply it with some best practices and build out the secure cluster. The focus on this is security threats to a Kubernetes cluster, containers and the apps deployed. A review of typical attack vectors in containers and Kubernetes clusters are shown with fun and exciting(?) pentesting tools specifically formulated for k8s. Now the fun begins - we have secured our cluster and our containers but how can we be sure? Let’s put our blue-skills to the test with some red-skills and pentest our cluster. It’s time to present some live security testing tools that are best suited for testing k8s. This is where the rubber meets the road, or in this case, where, wait for it —– common sense prevails!!<br></small>

                               "Guerrilla Red Team is a methodology by which a company can grow security IQ, technical expertise, and security brainpower, resulting in an internal mesh network of trusted decentralized ethical hackers. The program requires minimal capital investment from the hosting red team. It achieves its primary goals through weekly group mentorship hosted during a four-hour block, once per week, during the workday. It forms a peer network in which guerrilla operators share ideas and techniques, and ultimately grow technically and professionally as a unit. Members of the program come from various technical disciplines, but not necessarily security-focused verticals. The cohort of five to six members follows a nine-week syllabus that takes them from someone with minimal red team experience to autonomous operations. Guerrilla Operators will have a regular cadence of operations, which will require deconfliction from the parent red team to only ensure there are no safety concerns with the proposed target. Expected outcomes for the nine-week cohort are as follows: Guerrilla operators are armed with the skills to continue their red team learning, as well as a support network for challenging tasks The parent red team has an expanded network of internal, trusted, ethical hackers. This strengthens idea generation for campaigns, and enables communication through the use of a shared and common technical language. Over time, the Guerrilla Red Team provides a steady flow of trained homegrown red team operators or security analysts The company itself benefits by having security-focused mindsets placed throughout technical disciplines, resulting in staff that are poised to ward off attacks by thinking like an attacker, functioning similarly to security-focused Site Reliability Engineers (SRE) Provides the company with verification that their security program and infrastructure are as robust as they say it is through the use of decentralized, independent low-tier actors attacking the network: an Offsec ChaosMonkey Provides the guerrilla operators real world, hands on experience in a career field that is hard to break into outside of the Federal pipeline "</small>

This talk will focus on how to emulate a ransomware attack without introducing risk. We will understand how ransomware works, learn how criminals are evolving to get paid, create an adversary emulation plan that is safe but valuable for enterprises, and discuss how to defend against ransomware attacks.<br><br>Adversary Emulation is a type of ethical hacking engagement where the Red Team emulates how an adversary operates, leveraging the same tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), against a target organization. The goal of these engagements is to train and improve people, process, and technology. This is in contrast to a penetration test that focuses on testing technology and preventive controls. Adversary emulations are performed using a structured approach following industry methodologies and frameworks (such as MITRE ATT&amp;CK) and leverage Cyber Threat Intelligence to emulate a malicious actor that has the opportunity, intent, and capability to attack the target organization. Adversary Emulations may be performed in a blind manner (Red Team Engagement) or non-blind (Purple Team) with the Blue Team having full knowledge of the engagement.</small>

                        <small class="mbr-author-desc mbr-italic mbr-light mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong><em>Abstract</em></strong>: "In this talk, we'll introduce DropEngine -- a modular framework for creating malleable initial access payloads (also known as ""droppers"" or ""shellcode runners"").<br>Initial access payloads serve a deceptively simple purpose: loading implants from disk into memory. However, a number of obstacles stand in the way of this seemingly mundane task. To start with, the payload must safely be delivered to its intended target (usually via spearphishing). During delivery, the payload is exposed to signature-based detections and analyzed from within an automated sandbox. The payload must then be saved to disk without triggering antivirus, and must load the implant into memory without alerting Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR). Due to the widespread use of application whitelisting, payload authors are restricted to languages that are compatible with ""Live Off the Land Binaries and Scripts"" (LOLBAS), most of which are executed through the Windows Common Language Runtime (CLR). This means that most payloads must also contend with Microsoft's Anti-Malware Scan Interface (AMSI). Finally, the payload must be able to withstand analysis by threat hunters and reverse engineers. These obstacles are not insurmountable. However, defense evasion techniques tend to have a short shelf-life, and become particularly stale after repeated use. Because of this, payloads are often prepared on a per-engagement basis, which is hardly an easy feat when done by hand. DropEngine addresses this problem by providing a malleable framework for creating shellcode runners. Operators can choose from a selection of components and combine them to create highly sophisticated payloads within seconds. Available payload components include crypters, execution mechanisms, and environmental and remote keying functions. Also included are pre-execution modules such as sandbox checks and AMSI bypasses, as well cleanup modules that execute after the implant is loaded into memory. DropEngine comes pre-packaged with example modules that are more than sufficient to bypass signature and heuristic-based detections at the time of writing. However, DropEngine's true strength is that it improves operational efficiency by providing a high degree standardization, while allowing operators to control just about every aspect of the payload's signature and behavior."</small>

                               Abstract</em></strong>: Zero Trust – A Vision for Securing Cloud Delivered Business The success of early stories of adoption pushed many organizations not only to take the cloud seriously but also to make it the priority.<br>Many ideas of digitizations are built on the cloud. COVID-19 pandemic has further accelerated it in an unprecedented way, primarily due to almost all workforce working remotely, and applications meant for deployed over the closed network are increasingly opened for remote access—however, decisions of moving to the cloud is always contested on the basis of security and privacy. People and devices coming on the corporate network is the critical concern. The security is architected on believing everyone inside the network is trusted—but nowhere remains true in the current paradigm. Trust will never be deterministic based on pre-decided criteria. It has to be earned every time, and at every instant, you seek access.<br><br>In the talk, we will explore the concept of zero trust and will try to demystify zero trust models. The talk will focus on implementation and deployment scenarios of zero trust for organizations, How should the business prepare for the transition, what are the architectural requirements and what policies are required to be implemented? Also what Red teamers can take away and leverage the framework to see the security flaws in an organisation.<br></small>

                        <small class="mbr-author-desc mbr-italic mbr-light mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong><em>Abstract</em></strong>: "Oftentimes one of the greatest challenges for security professionals today is finding a way to effectively communicate the state of a network’s security posture, and what steps are necessary to achieve the organization’s security goals. Red teamers are already familiar with executing a typical Breach and Attack simulation, but how can they take greater advantage of their findings, and better yet, share those with the C-suite?  <br>The Infection Monkey is a mature, widely-used Open Source GPLv3 licensed tool specifically developed for enterprise red teams. Designed to test an organization’s detection and response methods and teams, the Monkey simulates all steps of an attack by mimicking a variety of adversary moves such as scanning, exploitation, lateral movement, password stealing, network mapping, security control bypass and more. <br>Overall, the Infection Monkey’s simulation reveals it contains a lot of stages one might find in a manual penetration test (or in a real attack). The Monkey is easily configurable, and starts from a single machine and propagates according to the test scenario while collecting data, employing attack tactics, performing security tests and looking for more machines to attack. The results are generated in real-time, shown in a network map and also presented in 3 detailed reports. With the Monkey, red teams can autonomously test specific parts of the network with multiple attack scenarios on a regular basis - like executing a lateral movement scenario from an internet-facing server to a sensitive system deployed in a different part of the network.<br>Further, the Monkey maps its findings to both the MITRE ATT&amp;CK knowledgebase and Forrester’s Zero Trust framework to provide in-depth reports with actionable recommendations for achieving a stronger security posture. When mapping to the Zero Trust framework, the report identifies and prioritizes the steps and decisions required to achieve a true Zero Trust network - whether that’s verifying that the current security stack meets Zero trust requirements or outlining specific actions that blue teams can perform to implement better security measures. By mapping the reports to MITRE ATT&amp;CK, the Monkey communicates the results of the attack in plain language, making the advanced tool accessible and effective for any red team. These reports enable security professionals to address and improve their security posture using the metrics, methods, and ideas they already care about aka if your CISO wants to achieve Zero Trust, their team can clearly map out the steps required to get there with the Monkey’s reports.<br>In this talk, Penetration Testers, Network Engineers, Exploit Developers, and other Security professionals will experience a typical Breach &amp; Attack simulation through the lens of the Monkey to learn how open source solutions can improve and add efficiencies to their teams. Shay will take attendees through a demo of Infection Monkey to demonstrate a typical “before and after” scenario with the Monkey. He will run the Monkey in a test environment, aka the “before,” to identify security gaps and then mitigate the issues using advice offered by the Monkey’s reporting. Finally, Shay will run the Monkey in the “after” environment to show how effective this Breach and Attack simulation can be in strengthening security posture.<br>"</small>
