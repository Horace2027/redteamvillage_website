Cloud is an enabler for businesses to become more agile, scalable, and global to maintain a competitive advantage.<br>There are numerous opportunities for red teamers to adopt these same modern strategies to level up their skills, platforms, and yes, even reporting. Attendees will learn how to begin integrating cloud capabilities, scientific notebooks, and aggregated datasets into a highly efficient operating model. We will walkthrough cloud technologies including AWS SageMaker, Athena, Lambda, and API Gateway to build an end-to-end ecosystem of automation. This session will provide demos, accelerators, and code releases to make both routine processes and innovative techniques faster, repeatable, and scalable. "</small>

                        <small class="mbr-author-desc mbr-italic mbr-light mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong><em>Abstract</em></strong>: "In this talk, we'll introduce DropEngine -- a modular framework for creating malleable initial access payloads (also known as ""droppers"" or ""shellcode runners"").<br>Initial access payloads serve a deceptively simple purpose: loading implants from disk into memory. However, a number of obstacles stand in the way of this seemingly mundane task. To start with, the payload must safely be delivered to its intended target (usually via spearphishing). During delivery, the payload is exposed to signature-based detections and analyzed from within an automated sandbox. The payload must then be saved to disk without triggering antivirus, and must load the implant into memory without alerting Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR). Due to the widespread use of application whitelisting, payload authors are restricted to languages that are compatible with ""Live Off the Land Binaries and Scripts"" (LOLBAS), most of which are executed through the Windows Common Language Runtime (CLR). This means that most payloads must also contend with Microsoft's Anti-Malware Scan Interface (AMSI). Finally, the payload must be able to withstand analysis by threat hunters and reverse engineers. These obstacles are not insurmountable. However, defense evasion techniques tend to have a short shelf-life, and become particularly stale after repeated use. Because of this, payloads are often prepared on a per-engagement basis, which is hardly an easy feat when done by hand. DropEngine addresses this problem by providing a malleable framework for creating shellcode runners. Operators can choose from a selection of components and combine them to create highly sophisticated payloads within seconds. Available payload components include crypters, execution mechanisms, and environmental and remote keying functions. Also included are pre-execution modules such as sandbox checks and AMSI bypasses, as well cleanup modules that execute after the implant is loaded into memory. DropEngine comes pre-packaged with example modules that are more than sufficient to bypass signature and heuristic-based detections at the time of writing. However, DropEngine's true strength is that it improves operational efficiency by providing a high degree standardization, while allowing operators to control just about every aspect of the payload's signature and behavior."</small>

                        <small class="mbr-author-desc mbr-italic mbr-light mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong><em>
                               Abstract</em></strong>: Android application markets are making a crucial shift in the manner software which was delivered to the end-users. Android applications face increasingly more security threats. The fuzzing technique can be used to uncover the security threats of applications. Fuzzing can be summarized similarly to the way toward sending irregular or invalid information as a contribution to a framework, to crash the framework and uncovering conceivable security vulnerabilities. Various research has been published in the android application fuzzing domain, while not many researches have addressed the security vulnerabilities in an android application by using external (another device used for operations) fuzzing techniques. However, current research doesn't address the android application fuzzing using an internal tool (or itself android device). The significance of the area, this paper seeks after two targets: to give a complete systematic literature review (SLR) of android application fuzzing, requirement’s for android application fuzzing. This paper reviewed previous research study in android application fuzzing, also methods dependent on necessities in Kitchenham’s systematic literature review guidelines. The systematic literature review result has shown the following deficiencies: Internal tool is not considered for fuzzing android application; and studies that are lacking in terms of requirement types. Furthermore, we proposed strong future directions of fuzzing for android application using internal tool. In particular, revealing threats of android applications by fuzzing techniques enables developers to build more secure applications and increases the mutual trust of its users.</small>

                        <small class="mbr-author-desc mbr-italic mbr-light mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong><em>Abstract</em></strong>: "Oftentimes one of the greatest challenges for security professionals today is finding a way to effectively communicate the state of a network’s security posture, and what steps are necessary to achieve the organization’s security goals. Red teamers are already familiar with executing a typical Breach and Attack simulation, but how can they take greater advantage of their findings, and better yet, share those with the C-suite?  <br>The Infection Monkey is a mature, widely-used Open Source GPLv3 licensed tool specifically developed for enterprise red teams. Designed to test an organization’s detection and response methods and teams, the Monkey simulates all steps of an attack by mimicking a variety of adversary moves such as scanning, exploitation, lateral movement, password stealing, network mapping, security control bypass and more. <br>Overall, the Infection Monkey’s simulation reveals it contains a lot of stages one might find in a manual penetration test (or in a real attack). The Monkey is easily configurable, and starts from a single machine and propagates according to the test scenario while collecting data, employing attack tactics, performing security tests and looking for more machines to attack. The results are generated in real-time, shown in a network map and also presented in 3 detailed reports. With the Monkey, red teams can autonomously test specific parts of the network with multiple attack scenarios on a regular basis - like executing a lateral movement scenario from an internet-facing server to a sensitive system deployed in a different part of the network.<br>Further, the Monkey maps its findings to both the MITRE ATT&amp;CK knowledgebase and Forrester’s Zero Trust framework to provide in-depth reports with actionable recommendations for achieving a stronger security posture. When mapping to the Zero Trust framework, the report identifies and prioritizes the steps and decisions required to achieve a true Zero Trust network - whether that’s verifying that the current security stack meets Zero trust requirements or outlining specific actions that blue teams can perform to implement better security measures. By mapping the reports to MITRE ATT&amp;CK, the Monkey communicates the results of the attack in plain language, making the advanced tool accessible and effective for any red team. These reports enable security professionals to address and improve their security posture using the metrics, methods, and ideas they already care about aka if your CISO wants to achieve Zero Trust, their team can clearly map out the steps required to get there with the Monkey’s reports.<br>In this talk, Penetration Testers, Network Engineers, Exploit Developers, and other Security professionals will experience a typical Breach &amp; Attack simulation through the lens of the Monkey to learn how open source solutions can improve and add efficiencies to their teams. Shay will take attendees through a demo of Infection Monkey to demonstrate a typical “before and after” scenario with the Monkey. He will run the Monkey in a test environment, aka the “before,” to identify security gaps and then mitigate the issues using advice offered by the Monkey’s reporting. Finally, Shay will run the Monkey in the “after” environment to show how effective this Breach and Attack simulation can be in strengthening security posture.<br>"</small>
