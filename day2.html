                        <small class="mbr-author-desc mbr-italic mbr-light mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong><em>Abstract</em></strong>: "Modern attacks against complex network infrastructure highlight a massive gap between state-affiliated cyber espionage attacks and Red Teams. As Red Teams face challenges that real-world attackers do not, replicating the sophisticated threat groups becomes all the more challenging with tight engagement deadlines and report submissions. The talk aims to bridge this gap by providing insights into modern tradecraft employed by the apex predators as well as the coin-miners and ransomware authors. The talk will also discuss the unique relationship between speed and stealth during Red Team operations. Sometimes ""speed is the new stealth"" but with evolved defensive technologies that baseline behaviour of endpoints on the host and network level, slow and steady may be the way to go instead. Additionally, the talk will walk through publicly-known implant design considerations to defeat mature host and network defences. Bleeding-edge credential harvesting techniques and the evolution of running Invoke-Mimikatz.ps1 to digging deep into C/C++ and Win32 API programming will be featured. Lastly, the evolution of a modern Red Team operator/developer/both will be discussed. The skills and mindset required to successfully complete objectives and evade defences have changed over time. A Red Teamer must evolve to be able to inform defence better."</small>

                               Abstract</em></strong>: Red Team activities are undoubtedly one of the fastest developing solutions against the cyber attacks of today. In this talk, we'll take a look at our work on an open-source proactive machine learning powered automation tool that performs red team simulations. This automation tool provides the opportunity to try out all available attack scenarios, thereby helping the community, especially organizations, to develop mechanisms to protect against these attacks before attackers do. Currently, red, blue and purple teams are improving day by day with the contributions made by open source. We will demonstrate the scenario playbook developed to collect the scenarios prepared for the red, blue and purple team on a single scenario place. The aim of this playbook is to protect the systems from such attack vectors, to examine the attack scenarios, to protect their systems by viewing the protection mechanisms and to contribute to these scenarios. With the built-in Scenario Place, people can either run these scenarios or check the scenario configurations on their systems. All scenario titles are prepared in accordance with MITRE and Cyber Kill Chain.<br>All scenarios from various teams such as Atomic Red Team, Mitre and TIBER-EU are fed into the application as input.&nbsp;</small>

Initially, a brief review about types of persistance, locations where it can be deploy and common aspects to be taken into account will be carried out, to then go on to describe all the details that allow a Red Team to guarantee access to the entity without the organization being able to detect it or being able to expel the attacker before the attacker re-enters using another alternative persistence.<br>The presentation will feature the following highlights:<br>- General introduction to the concepts necessary to understand the details regarding the scenarios where it is necessary to deploy persistence in an organization (in real intrusion).<br>- Reverse connection typology such as situations where there is direct access to the Internet, connection via proxy, proxy with authentication, DNS, …<br>- Infrastructure and techniques for persistence deployment, indicating the type of servers and advanced techniques such as Domain fronting, IP laundry, ...<br>- Traditional deployment of persistence on an organization both in existing systems in DMZ, internal servers, workstations, Cloud servers, Active Directory, …<br>- Alternative persistence to guarantee unknown access through users with predictable credentials based on password history, Wireless backdoor on workstations (in both directions), extracting internal WiFi passwords, pivoting through resource reconstruction, periodic tasks to modify AD setting, monthly Outlook rules configured and upload interna GAL table of users, visual information extraction using screen and others. <br>- Anti-forensic techniques for the deployment of persistence, to avoid the identification of these by the Security team.<br>- Types of behavior to act and techniques when the security team detects a persistence, allowing access to the entity to be recovered before having lost access to company.<br>The combined use of the exposed techniques and actions, as will be shown in the presentation, means that the security team does not have the ability to expel the Red Team in any case, allowing the intrusion to be carried out with greater freedom.<br>The presentation is the result of experience in developing deep Red Team exercises on the main organizations in Spain (IBEX35), as well as large banking and industrial entities in Europe and America for more than 6 years.<br>After the presentation, an Open Source tool will be published to help in the development of the persistence deployment.</small>

                        <small class="mbr-author-desc mbr-italic mbr-light mbr-fonts-style display-7">Python 3.8, released October 2019, boasts a new security feature called “audit hooks”. According to PEP 578 and PEP 551, the purpose of audit hooking is to allow transparency into Python’s runtime so that events can be monitored and logged just like any other process. While additional insight is great for defenders, it's likely to become another hurdle for attackers to overcome in the same vein as PowerShell. Y'all tryna bypass these audit hooks or nah?

                        <small class="mbr-author-desc mbr-italic mbr-light mbr-fonts-style display-7">"Quite often, you may have heard people mention, “Why should you bother learning PowerShell, isn’t it dead?” or “Why not just use C#?” Many individuals in the offensive security field have a common misconception that PowerShell is obsolete for red team operations. Meanwhile, it remains one of the primary attack vectors employed by Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs). APTs are known for implementing sophisticated hacking tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to gain access to a system for an extended period of time. Their actions typically focus on high-value targets, which leave potentially crippling consequences to both nation-states and corporations. It is crucial that Red Teams accurately emulate real-world threats and do not ignore viable attack options. For this talk, we will walk through how many threat actors adapt and employ PowerShell tools. Our discussion begins with examining how script block logging and AMSI are powerful anti-offensive PowerShell measures. However, the implementation of script block logging places a technical burden on organizations to conduct auditing on a substantial amount of data. While AMSI is trivial to bypass for any capable adversary. Finally, we will demonstrate APT-like PowerShell techniques that remain incredibly effective against the latest generation of network defenses.<br>"</small>

                        <small class="mbr-author-desc mbr-italic mbr-light mbr-fonts-style display-7">Adversary emulation has become an increasingly common type of engagement where red teams look to known threat groups to inspire the actions and behaviors used. While scoping activity might make operating easier, emulation introduces a new set of challenges to planning. How do you know how an adversary behaves? What do you do if you only know part of the picture? How do you turn all of that into a plan? In this talk I’ll examine how we can start building an adversary profile from the open source intel in MITRE ATT&amp;CK. Open source intel often doesn’t give a complete picture of an adversary, and I’ll talk about some of where these gaps come from, how to spot them, and some ways of filling them in. I’ll work through a process for turning the profile we’ve created into an adversary emulation plan expressed in ATT&amp;CK and how we can stay aligned with that plan as we operate.</small>

                        <small class="mbr-author-desc mbr-italic mbr-light mbr-fonts-style display-7">Abstract: Red Team activities are undoubtedly one of the fastest developing solutions against the cyber attacks of today. In this talk, we'll take a look at our work on an open-source proactive machine learning powered automation tool that performs red team simulations. This automation tool provides the opportunity to try out all available attack scenarios, thereby helping the community, especially organizations, to develop mechanisms to protect against these attacks before attackers do. Currently, red, blue and purple teams are improving day by day with the contributions made by open source. We will demonstrate the scenario playbook developed to collect the scenarios prepared for the red, blue and purple team on a single scenario place. The aim of this playbook is to protect the systems from such attack vectors, to examine the attack scenarios, to protect their systems by viewing the protection mechanisms and to contribute to these scenarios. With the built-in Scenario Place, people can either run these scenarios or check the scenario configurations on their systems. All scenario titles are prepared in accordance with MITRE and Cyber Kill Chain.<br>All scenarios from various teams such as Atomic Red Team, Mitre and TIBER-EU are fed into the application as input.&nbsp;</small>

How to perform threat hunting on the dark web? If you are curious about the answers to these questions, then this talk is for you. Dark web hosts several sites where criminals buy, sell, and trade goods and services like drugs, weapons, exploits, etc. Hunting on the dark web can help identify, profile, and mitigate any organization risks if done timely and appropriately. This is why threat intelligence obtained from the dark web can be crucial for any organization. In this presentation, you will learn why threat hunting on the dark web is necessary, different methodologies to perform hunting, the process after hunting, and how hunted data is analyzed. The main focus of this talk will be automating the threat hunting on the dark web. You will also get to know what operational security (OpSec) is and why it is essential while performing hunting on the dark web and how you can employ it in your daily life.</small>

In this talk we have decided to go beyond the classic concept of a malicious pendrive. We use a set of classic USB speakers from a well-known brand available worldwide, which we disassemble to add our own hardware modification. This modification, which consists of cheap parts that can be acquired worldwide, makes this set of speakers an unprecedented local and remote attack vector: a device that looks and functions as a speaker, but is capable of acting as a keyboard, exfiltrate information, and use a SIM card to receive remote commands by telephone to leak information. When connected, the speaker passively waits for a phone call to its internal SIM from a specific number. Upon receiving it, launches a payload against the computer to which it was connected, allowing the attacker to obtain a shell. Now then, what would happen if someone left this speaker in its original box in a corner of an office? What would happen if someone connected this innocent device to their work terminal? Well, it is a speaker after all. And it definitely sounds legit... "</small>

                               "BadUSB devices are popular worldwide, and almost no one ignores their nature: an object with a USB connection (usually a pendrive) connects to a computer and tells it ""I am a keyboard"", proceeding to send (""type"") arbitrary commands, usually malicious. In this talk we have decided to go beyond the classic concept of a malicious pendrive. We use a set of classic USB speakers from a well-known brand available worldwide, which we disassemble to add our own hardware modification. This modification, which consists of cheap parts that can be acquired worldwide, makes this set of speakers an unprecedented local and remote attack vector: a device that looks and functions as a speaker, but is capable of acting as a keyboard, exfiltrate information, and use a SIM card to receive remote commands by telephone to leak information. When connected, the speaker passively waits for a phone call to its internal SIM from a specific number. Upon receiving it, launches a payload against the computer to which it was connected, allowing the attacker to obtain a shell. Now then, what would happen if someone left this speaker in its original box in a corner of an office? What would happen if someone connected this innocent device to their work terminal? Well, it is a speaker after all. And it definitely sounds legit... "</small>

In this talk we will walk-through a number of the (free!) tools one can utilize when performing adversarial simulations, provide insights on how to “sell” an assumed-compromise engagement as a Red/Blue/Purple Team, and some helpful places to start with MITRE ATT&amp;CK technique alignment for offense &amp; defense.</small>
